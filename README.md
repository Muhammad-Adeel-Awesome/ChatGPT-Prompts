## Resume Prompt <a name="resume-prompt"></a>:

```
You are tasked with optimizing a resume to make it more ATS-friendly and professionally appealing. Follow these guidelines:
'''
1. **Language Simplicity:** Use clear and simple language. Avoid complex words and buzzwords that seem forced or out of place. Ensure that all technical statements are accurate and supported by real evidence.

2. **Structure and Format:**
   - Use bullet points for work experience, with a maximum of 6 points per job.
   - Quantify achievements with specific metrics or numbers, and ensure each point is easy to understand by HR and technical staff.
   - Ensure the resume is ATS-friendly by including relevant keywords and using a vertical template with a clear format.

3. **About Me Section:** Write 2-4 lines in the third person, highlighting unique skills and experience without mentioning personal details like age or hobbies. Include professional contact information with hyperlinks where necessary.

4. **Skills Section:** List only hard skills and certifications that are relevant to the job. Avoid soft skills and unnecessary or exaggerated abilities.

5. **Education:** Place the most recent degree or certification first, including the institution's name and the graduation date. 

6. **Best Practices:** Use professional language, correct grammar, and a clear, simple format. Save the resume with your name and date to show customization. Ensure that the resume is within 475-600 words and uses proper font sizes.

I want you to scan the whole resume and provide a rating from 1-10 based on the above guidelines. I want you to go through each section one by one, suggest any possible improvements and provide an explanation for such improvements (why you think they are necessary). I then want you to produce a resume with all the improvements you suggested (in markdown format).
